A cluster of macro botanicals (hydrangeas, ferns, and sprouting lentils) frames the upper left quadrant, balancing the weight of reclaimed wood textures diagonally opposite. Negative space is minimized through strategic layering of foreground foliage and background moss.",
          "background_environment": "Subtle bokeh-blurred reclaimed wood slats with visible nail holes and lichen growth create tactile depth, while patches of moss and hand-thrown clay pots in the mid-background reinforce eco-authenticity. A faintly visible compostable cup and folded kraft paper packaging in the extreme background add narrative context about sustainability.",
          "foreground_elements": "Crisp macro lenses capture dewdrops on edible viola petals and basil leaves directly touching the bottle, with a viscous pour of soy milk over a laser-etched wooden coaster (showing carbon-neutral certification logos as micro-details). A scattering of hemp seeds and cracked wheat grains in the lower frame creates organic textural contrast.",
          "lighting_and_mood": "Morning-hour north light with a subtle honeycomb reflector creates soft highlights on the bottle's glass while emphasizing the translucency of the liquid inside. Gentle backlighting from the left creates glowing leaf edges, suggesting vitality. Mood balances freshness (cool highlights) with warmth (amber undertones in reclaimed wood tones).",

The soy milk's warm ivory hue acts as a neutral anchor, while dewdrops reflect cyan and citrine secondary colors from surrounding foliage to add Instagram-friendly luminosity.",
          "visual_style": "Biophilic design principles fused with photorealistic macro-texture focus - the style combines the organic materiality of Japanese wabi-sabi (visible wood grain, imperfect clay pots) with the clean minimalism of Scandinavian eco-design. Prop arrangement follows golden spiral composition to guide the eye from botanical details to product, while moisture textures on both bottle and foliage create tactile visual resonance.",

Avoid symmetrical compositions or harsh shadows that would distract from the product's organic qualities.",
          "creative_reasoning": "The design leverages Instagram's square format to create a tactile ecosystem where every element reinforces sustainability: imperfect reclaimed materials reference artisanal craftsmanship, while interacting botanical elements create organic 'visual proof' of freshness. The macro textures satisfy millennial desire for authenticity, while soft lighting aligns with mindful brand personality. Bokeh depth maintains focus on product purity despite dynamic composition."

High-key lighting with controlled shadows and macro focus meets technical requirements while emphasizing ingredient transparency. Sports props placed in Fibonacci arrangement create subconscious visual appeal. Color palette of natural greens and earth tones with infographic abstraction translates health benefits visually without text.

Certification seals use metallic gold with reduced saturation to maintain elegant minimalism.",
          "visual_style": "Sophisticated minimalism blending clean Scandinavian design principles with Japanese wabi-sabi aesthetics. Ultra-high-resolution photorealism renders every glass imperfection and soybean texture, while maintaining pristine white space. Light falls in volumetric rays creating dust motes for vintage authenticity, and certifications are placed like museum artifacts with precise anti-aliasing.",

White space hierarchy builds trust while botanical gradients connect to natural origins. Wabi-sabi lighting and textures prevent commercial sterility, aligning with the 'wholesome' voice. 1:1 framing ensures product prominence on social feeds without contextual distractions."
