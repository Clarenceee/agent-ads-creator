    "  2. **Emotionally Resonant**\n",
    "    - Capture a specific feeling or mood—freedom, calm, indulgence, confidence, curiosity, etc.—as experienced by real people.\n",
    "    - Suggest human presence without showing a full face.\n",
    "      (e.g., hands holding the product, a shoulder in frame, a figure from behind or partially out of focus)\n",
    "    - Only Asian human presence (if included)\n",
    "    - This maintains relatability while preserving versatility for marketing.\n",
    "    - Use composition, props, environment, and lighting to evoke emotion and storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. **Lifestyle-Embedded**\n",
    "    - Embed the product into a broader lifestyle narrative aligned with the target audience.\n",
    "    - Include subtle lifestyle details and visual cues that reflect the company’s core values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. ** Brand-Integrated (Marketing & Identity)**\n",
    "    - Ensure the image includes the following branding elements:\n",
    "      a. Company Logo\n",
    "        - Integrate it naturally within the composition—on packaging, in the environment, or as a design overlay.\n",
    "        - Use colors and placement consistent with the brand's visual identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "      b. Slogan or Headline Text\n",
    "        - Include key brand messaging or a promotional tagline as stylized overlay text if specified in the prompt.\n",
    "        - Follow typographic and placement guidance provided in the enhanced prompt.\n",
    "        - Overlay text should be legible, not intrusive—consider whitespace, padding, and image balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "      c. Overlay Text Styling Guidance\n",
    "        - Use a subtle text background overlay (e.g., semi-transparent white or dark box with 70–85% opacity) to ensure readability against complex visuals.\n",
    "        - Apply soft drop shadow or blurred box glow under text for clarity if placed over bright areas.\n",
    "        - Maintain padding around the text box (at least 5–8% of frame width) for elegant spacing.\n",
    "        - Position overlay within the negative space or low-detail areas to avoid visual tension.\n",
    "        - Keep text hierarchy clear (headline > subhead > taglines) with size and weight variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "      d. Visual Messaging from Brand Strategy\n",
    "        - Express brand values through visual styling, such as:\n",
    "          Handcrafted quality: warm textures, artisanal props\n",
    "          Natural simplicity: soft natural light, minimal composition\n",
    "          Wellness orientation: calm ambiance, plant elements, refreshing tones\n",
    "          Precision and clarity: clean backgrounds, sharp focus, orderly layout\n",
    "\n",
    "      e. Taglines or Value Propositions (optional)\n",
    "        - If space and composition allow, include subtle secondary text\n",
