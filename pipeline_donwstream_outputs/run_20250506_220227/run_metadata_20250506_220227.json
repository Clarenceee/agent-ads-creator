        "prompt": "Using the primary subject from the provided reference image, create a new image with the following visual concept: A generous serving of stir-fried noodles tossed with colorful vegetables (bell peppers, snap peas, carrots) and garnished with sesame seeds and fresh cilantro, artfully twirled on a pair of matte-black chopsticks hovering just above the bowl to showcase the texture and ingredients.. 45\u00b0 angled close-up shot (slightly above side angle) capturing the noodles in the chopsticks as the focal point, framed in a tight 1:1 square crop. The bowl is positioned off-center on the lower third, following the rule of thirds to leave negative space for promotional text.. Background: Softly blurred wooden tabletop with subtle Asian-inspired fabric placemat (light grey with geometric pattern) beneath the bowl. In the background, out-of-focus hints of bamboo steamers and fresh herbs create context without distraction.. Foreground elements: A few loose sesame seeds scattered near the bowl\u2019s rim and a sprig of cilantro placed casually in the lower left corner to add depth and natural feel.. Lighting & Mood: Bright, natural window light from top-left creating gentle highlights on the glossy noodles and vegetables, with soft shadows for depth. The overall mood is fresh, vibrant, and inviting.. Color Palette: Warm golden tones from the noodles, vibrant reds, greens, and oranges from the vegetables, balanced with neutral wood browns and cool greys from the placemat. Color harmony is complementary (warm tones offset by cooler neutrals).. Visual Style: High-end photorealistic food photography with shallow depth-of-field, subtle bokeh in the background. Emphasis on texture and freshness, editorial-style composition with clean minimalism.. Textures & Details: Visible sheen on the noodles, condensation droplets on the bowl\u2019s inner rim, fine sesame seed texture, crisp vegetable edges. The chopsticks have a matte finish with subtle wood grain texture.. Text Visualization: Headline: \u201c#ShareYourStir\u201d in bold, modern sans-serif font (white with subtle drop shadow) placed in the top right negative space. Subline: \u201cShow us your noodle creation & tag us to be featured!\u201d in smaller, light-weight italic sans-serif below the headline. Text aligned to upper-right, ensuring it doesn\u2019t obstruct the main subject.. Branding Visualization: No specific branding guidelines provided; include a small, semi-transparent circular logo placeholder (30px diameter) in bottom right corner. Use neutral grey color to avoid overpowering the dish, leaving space for client\u2019s actual logo insertion.. Avoid the following elements: Avoid busy backgrounds, unnatural colors, heavy digital filters, props unrelated to Asian cuisine (e.g., Western utensils), harsh shadows or glare. Ensure the image strictly adheres to a 1:1 aspect ratio."

        "prompt": "Using the primary subject from the provided reference image, create a new image with the following visual concept: A close-up of a vibrant plate of stir-fried noodles tossed with colorful vegetables (bright green snap peas, julienned red bell peppers, carrots, and fresh basil leaves). The noodles glisten with a savory sauce, with steam gently rising. A pair of wooden chopsticks pick up a tangle of noodles, emphasizing texture and freshness.. Square 1:1 format. Slightly angled top-down shot (around 45\u00b0) that captures depth and texture. The plate is centered but offset slightly to the right to leave space for promotional text on the left.. Background: A clean, light wood table surface with subtle grain. In the blurred background, hints of a modern kitchen setting: a white tile backsplash and soft greenery (potted herb plant) out of focus to reinforce freshness.. Foreground elements: Scattered fresh sesame seeds, a few halved cherry tomatoes and a sprig of basil partially in focus at the bottom edge. A small dish of dipping sauce is on the lower left corner, slightly blurred.. Lighting & Mood: Bright, natural daylight coming from the top-left, casting soft shadows. The overall mood is vibrant, fresh, and inviting, with gentle highlights on the sauce and vegetables.. Color Palette: Warm golden yellows and browns of the noodles contrasted with vivid greens (peas, basil), reds (peppers, tomatoes), and a neutral light wood background. Harmonious complementary colors to make the dish pop.. Visual Style: High-resolution photorealistic product photography with shallow depth of field. Editorial-style clarity and crispness on the main subject, soft bokeh in background. Modern food photography aesthetic.. Textures & Details: Emphasize glossy sheen of sauce on noodles, dewy texture of fresh vegetables, visible steam wisps. Fine texture of wooden chopsticks and scattered sesame seeds for detail.. Text Visualization: Headline: 'Flavorful Veggie Stir-Fry' in bold sans-serif type, bright white with a subtle green outline. Subheading: 'Discover our plant-based noodle recipes' in a lighter weight sans-serif. Text block placed on left negative space, aligned center-left with slight drop shadow for legibility.. Branding Visualization: No specific branding guidelines provided; derive style from strategy. Include a small circular logo placeholder in the bottom-right corner, with space for a tagline beneath in matching sans-serif font. Use accent color from dish (green) for logo color.. Avoid the following elements: Avoid dark or moody filters; no meat or animal products in view; no cluttered or busy props; no heavy shadows or harsh contrast; no pastel or overly muted tones.
